must have featues
	persist what levels have been done
	check update/physicsUpdate correctnes
	camera movement (sidescrolling), dont move while player interaction
	flipping indication (a rope connecting cursor and object)
	polish flipping (dont be able to move the cursor everywhere)
	fix bug: play -> pause -> main menu -> play: bottle does not become flipable -> pause -> play: bottle is flipable

nice to have
	polish level 1 and 2
	level 3
	different flipable types
		bottle - cas only stand on bottom
		can - can stand on bottom and top (easier)
	tell the player how awesome he is: "360 FLIP !" "its over 9000 !!!"
	restart flip button - if the player surrenders to his flip, he can reset the bottle right away
	dynamically spawn ingame prefabs
